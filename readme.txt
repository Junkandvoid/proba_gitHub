We use Git/GitHub so we can work on same projects easily. Every member of team can change HTML,CSS,
and other codes from home, and easily update them to git hub so everyone of the team can see what he did,
then other memers of the team can continue changing or commenting our work.
The best part is that every single update is saved, so if we make a mistake we can easily update the last file
that we have changed.
